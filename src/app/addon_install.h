// Installing and removing add-ons (docs/addons.md): a Lua script into scripts/<name>/, a compiled plugin into
// plugins/<name>/ or a tool (a program of its own) into tools/<name>/ of the Hailstone folder, from a package the add-on manager (app/addon_manager.h) downloaded and
// checked against its manifest. A Hailstone feature with no original counterpart. Everything of its own lives in
// <data>/addons/:
//   installed.txt   each add-on: where it came from, its version, key, capabilities, and every file it put in with
//                   its SHA-256 (so an update replaces only those, and a file the player changed is seen)
//   new/<name>/     a package unpacked and checked, before anything in its folder changes
//   previous/<name>/ the files an install or a removal is moving out, until it has finished
//   journal.txt     an install's or a removal's moves, one a line, so a cut-off one is undone at the next start
//   download/       the downloaded packages
// Nothing a package holds is trusted: what it may hold is what a server may send into the same folder
// (net::server_file_destination), a script needs an init.lua, a plugin exactly one library of this platform named
// after it (read from its header, never loaded), and every Lua file must compile as text (no precompiled chunks). A
// tool holds one program of this platform named after it at its top (read from its header, never run), may hold
// this platform's libraries beside it and data anywhere, and nothing else that runs.
