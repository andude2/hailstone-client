// (SpellEffectTimers_Add @0x564330, _Update @0x563f40, _Remove @0x564000, _PlayStage @0x563df0). An entry plays
// its effect's cast stage when added, the projectile stage when its elapsed time passes stage1_ms and the impact
// stage when it passes stage1_ms + stage1_length_ms, after which it is dropped. The effect is a spellsnew.eff index,
// and the emitters' key is spawn id << 16 | effect, as SpellEffect_SpawnStageEmitters makes it from its first
// argument. Nothing here draws: the caller plays the stages it is handed.
