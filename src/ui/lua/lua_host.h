// The Lua UI: windows written as Lua scripts over Dear ImGui (the `ui` table)
// and the game (the `eq` table). Scripts are loaded from the UI's folder (ui/<name>), reloaded
// when they change, and each window they register with ui.window(name, draw)
// is drawn once per frame. A script error never stops the client: it shows in
// the "UI errors" window and the failed window stays off until it reloads.
// Every chunk is loaded as text: no precompiled Lua (a binary chunk can corrupt memory).
